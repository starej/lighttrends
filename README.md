Lighttrends mapping application

Lighttrends application is a GIS web application that is designed to quickly display information about radiance trends at a specific location. It uses data from two satellite system DMSP and VIIRS operated by NOAA. New VIIRS layers are added automatically as soon as NOAA makes them available to public.
